# Analysis
  In this project we looked to find if temperature or rain had any impact on the chances of crimes being commited.
  
  We looked to answer 3 questions:
  
    1. What effect does increasing temperature/warm weather have on crime?
    
    2.What effect does decreasing temperature/colder weather have on crime?
    
    3.What effect does precipitation have on crime?
    
 Using the datasets to create charts to visualize relationships which we will show below.

## Conclusions
  
  The data shows that as expected temperature and rainfall generally follows the season (depending on location). As the season impact temperature and rainfall, we are looking to see if that in turn has an impact on crime. From analyzing the data, we can see crime only changes slightly from month to month, and does not have any meaningful relationship with temperature as our linear regression plot shows. However, the data does show that as the amount of rain increases, crime increases slightly as the linear regression plot shows.

Through completing our findings it is clear that there is no large meaningful relationship between crime and weather. These findings however are not concrete as we strictly looked at Kansas over a 5 year period. One could expand our research to include a larger sample size from both a geographic and timespan perspective. With future research one could draw a better picture of the links between crime and weather.
